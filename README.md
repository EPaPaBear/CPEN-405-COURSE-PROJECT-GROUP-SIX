# Machine Learning to Real Life Problem Using WEKA and MATLAB

In modern environment, technology advances at a breakneck pace, and we are constantly exposed to new innovations.
Artificial Intelligence is one of the burgeoning computer science technologies that is poised to usher in a new era in the world by creating intelligent machines. The term Artifical Intelligence is describesd as a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions. The project focuses on the use of subfields of AI such as machine learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation, optimization
and game theory to solve certain real life problems. The project is divided into three parts;
* PART 1: is mainly about machine learning using WEKA. Datasets are provided to this
end
* PART 2: involves the use of MATLAB and other software if necessary, to solve real-life
optimization case studies.
* PART 3: is concerned with interesting practical applications of machine learning knowledge. 
# Required softwares to access this project files
* WEKA for data mining and machine learning
* MATLAB for optimization problems 
# Insights on each part of the project
* PART 1 :
This part entails the use of the WEKA software to analyse, classify and draw conclusion using a selected dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It involves the use of classification algorithms such as the Naive Bayes, decision trees, Logistic regression etc to perform data mining task and draw analysis on a dataset.
